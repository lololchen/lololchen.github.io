description: The third-generation Sonnenwagen is an asymmetric three-wheeled catamaran that embodies optimum efficiency-oriented design. Despite the challenging COVID-19 conditions, the vehicle was successfully built in 2021 and raced in the adventurous Sahara desert in Morocco. </p>         <p> My contributions to the project include&colon;
bullet: <li>Strengthened the structural department with extensive knowledge and experience gained from the previous generation solar car, especially in composite development and CAD modeling for the monocoque chassis, external shell, and solar roof.</li>     <li>Optimized the cut-out structure of the solar roof to ensure ideal conductive cooling of the solar cells while maintaining shell stiffness in the windy desert.</li>     <li>Coordinated and oversaw the design, analysis, and manufacture of the most lightweight vehicle possible, while ensuring necessary stiffness and safety requirements.</li>     <li>Leading the production of a solar vehicle program and ensuring the accurate execution of the composite manufacturing process while maintaining consistent quality within an aggressive timeline.</li>
