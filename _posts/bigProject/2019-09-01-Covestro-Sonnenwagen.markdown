description: The Covestro Sonnenwagen was the first solar racing vehicle I ever built after joining the exciting student initiative, Team Sonnenwagen Aachen. Collaborating with over 40 dedicated members, we designed and constructed the most energy-efficient solar-powered vehicle from scratch in just one and a half years, and successfully finishing the epic solar racing event in the Australian Outback covering 3022 km. </p>         <p> My responsibilities included&colon;
bullet: <li>Designing and manufacturing the roll hoop using FDM 3D-printed direct tooling with ULTEM 1010, a high heat-resistant thermoplastic with low thermal expansion, enabling rapid and complex tooling production with accurate geometry during the pre-preg curing process. </li>                  <li> Inventing a novel scissor-mechanism design for opening the solar roof under limited design space, ensuring reliable and smooth operation by the driver while harvesting sun energy from any angle. </li>     <li> Generating several innovative vehicle concepts for aerodynamic exterior design and optimizing the final surface modeling quality for further internal development. </li>
