description: <strong>Bachelor Thesis&colon; Modeling, Simulation, and Control of an Lower Limb Exoskeleton for Human Walking Augmentation  </strong></p>         <p> In this thesis, a human locomotion model based on multibody dynamics is developed in Simulink/Simscape, which resulted a natural walking motion and provide a simulation framework for human-exoskeleton interaction. Upon that, a active powered lower limb exoskeleton is added in the model and a direct force controller consist of two sub-systems are introduced&colon; </p>         <p> Using the human inverse dynamic model, the <strong>Human Joint Torque Estimator</strong> calculate the real time muscular torques based on the measured lower limb joint kinematics and ground reaction forces. On the other hand, <strong>Exoskeleton Transparency Controller</strong> compensates for the undesired interaction forces caused by the mass, inertial, and friction from the robotic dynamics. </p>         <p> By combining the two torques with a support factor, the model-in-the-loop simulation results show promising augmentation efficacy by effectively reducing the requirement of human muscular torque.
