description: The AconityMICRO is a compact metal 3D printer designed specifically for MICRO L-PBF process, featuring a small laser spot size of 40µm and a thickness resolution of 10µm. Its clean and compact design ensures a user-friendly experience, making it the perfect choice for serial production of individual high resolution parts. As a contributor to the initial design concepts, I provided my skills in industrial design to help shape the final product.
