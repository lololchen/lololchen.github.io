description: <strong>Mini Thesis&colon; Analysis of the Potential of Active Aerodynamics for a Solar Vehicle </strong>         <br><br>- Conducted CFD simulations to analyze the effect of an active shape-variable vertical trailing edge on the sailing performance and drag reduction of a bullet-shaped solar vehicle.<br><br>- Designed and built a prototype of a morphing trailing edge using carbon fiber composite (CFRP) and polyurethane foam to demonstrate the feasibility of a ridged but shape-adaptive structural concept.
