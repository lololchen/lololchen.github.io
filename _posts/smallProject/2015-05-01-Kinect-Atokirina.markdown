description: As a graduate student at my high school, I had the opportunity to help decorate our school for the graduation ceremony, transforming it into a Universal Studios Theme Park. For our graduation, we chose Avatar as the theme to set up the entire event space. However, this year, we didn't just replicate the mystical Pandora jungle and floating Hallelujah Mountains with our skillful handicraft; we aimed to take it a step further and recreate an interactive experience with the Pandoran biosphere using a variety of creative technologies, such as light and sound effects and vivid creature models equipped with motorized mechanisms. <br><br>                     With this concept in mind, I came up with the idea to reconstruct the wondrous scene where Jake encounters a bunch of luminescing woodsprites in the dark jungle, using the Kinect skeletal tracking SDK. I approached two of my most talented friends, Vincent Fan and Yi-Ting Tu, to help develop this interactive art with their solid CS skills. After a few days of hardcore programming and debugging, we were thrilled to make every event participant even more immersed in Avatar's adventurous journey. <br><br>                       In fact, Vincent Fan even created a web version of the project, allowing you to play with the Woodsprites using only your mouse!
