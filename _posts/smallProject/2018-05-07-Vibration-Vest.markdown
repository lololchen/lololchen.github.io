description: In just 24 hours, we created a vibration vest during a hackathon to provide humans with an enhanced sense of their environment.  <br><br>                    By using computer vision (object and facial recognition) from two webcams, and 10 vibration motors that surround the chest, our vest generates specific vibration patterns to enable users to feel the orientation, velocity, and type of objects around them. From moving objects to facial expressions, this vest provides an innovative way to perceive the world around you.  <br><br>                    Our wearable device has the power to transform the lives of visually- or hearing-impaired individuals, enabling them to "feel" the surrounding objects and ambient sounds. It has endless practical applications, from remote vehicle detection to navigation, and even facial expressions. <br><br>                    Our team was inspired by two TED talks by Pranav Mistry and David Eagleman, which drove us to create this magnificent invention in record time.
