description: Modeling, Simulation, and Control of an Lower Limb Exoskeleton for Human Walking Augmentation
- Developed a human locomotion model based on multibody dynamics in Simulink/Simscape, which resulted a natural walking motion and provide a simulation framework for human-exoskeleton interaction.
- Designed a force control method with a Human Joint Torque Estimator and Exoskeleton Transparency Controller for active walking assistance, which shown the effective augmentation in the simulation.
